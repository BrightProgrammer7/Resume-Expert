Searching for a job can be incredibly daunting!

 We've all wondered why our resumes aren't getting picked or why our applications are being rejected. We crave feedback from HR but understand they are swamped with numerous applications. To address this issue, I developed an application called Job Fit Analyzer, which helps answer three crucial questions:

1. What's wrong with my resume?
2. What skills do I need to improve to get the job?
3. What important keywords am I missing for ATS tracking?

As a bonus, the app also answers your other personalized questions based on your resume and the job description.

I built this using Python and integrated a large language model (LLM), GEMINI, deploying it into a Streamlit application. Through this project, I learned a lot about integrating LLMs and how user-friendly Streamlit is for deploying apps.

Feel free to fork my repository and run the code to have your AI Resume Reviewer right at your fingertips.

A big thanks to Krish Naik for the inspiration and teachings.

I would love to hear your valuable feedback on this!
